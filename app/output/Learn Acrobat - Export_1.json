The original\nfile is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the\nchanges you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new\ninformation that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the\nautosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes\nof your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is\nespecially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments.\nYou can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you\nclose, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted."
