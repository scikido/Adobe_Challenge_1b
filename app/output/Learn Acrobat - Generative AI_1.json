Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are built upon powerful,\nemerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate\nor misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe’s views. This is\nespecially true if you try to use these features to generate outputs that are unrelated to your\nsource document.\nDo not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of\nprofessional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting\nyour own independent consultation or research.

Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful\ncues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is\npowered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all\nanswers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers\nto your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI\nAssistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation\nor cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on\nwhere the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated\nresponses.\nPlease note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is\ndifferent than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In\nsuch scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive\nclickable citations in the response."
